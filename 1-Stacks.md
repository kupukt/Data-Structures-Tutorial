# Stacks

Stacks are just one of the many data structures used in programming today. A stack is a linear data structure
in that it follows one path. This is explained simply in FILO or LOFI. FILO is first in last out, and LOFI
is last out first in. We can think of stacks as literal stacks, stacking up plates, taking out pringles from a pringle can, and
anything else that has to do with

## Operations With Stacks

Stacks have basic functions that are performed with it to allow it to do what it was meant to do and also functions that are there that are practicle for the data structure. Here are the Functions:

* Append
* Pop
* Empty
* Size

### Append

Append is an operation used with a stack to add items to the back of the stack.
For Example:

```python
stack = {}
number = 43
stack.append(number)
 ```
